    "- Descriptive Analysis to establish the distribution and central tendency of each social connection type and resilience measure across demographics.\n",
    "- Multivariate Regression to evaluate the predictive power of different social connections on resilience and distress levels, with interaction terms to examine demographic effects.\n",

    "**Possible Results**\n",
    "This analysis may reveal that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Certain Connection Types Predict Resilience: Family or peer connections could enhance resilience significantly, particularly for younger adults or students. Social media connections might show a weaker or even negative association with resilience.\n",
    "- Demographic Moderation: The stress-buffering effect of connections may vary across demographics, with family support possibly being more beneficial for younger respondents and peer connections more impactful for students.\n",

    "### Relevance to Course Project Objectives\n",
    "This analysis could provide actionable insights by identifying which types of social connections most effectively support mental resilience. Findings may:\n",
    "\n",
